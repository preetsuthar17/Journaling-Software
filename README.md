# Journaling-Software

Most basic journaling software is created using Python and converted into a .exe file using `PyInstaller`

## Functionalties ðŸ“¦

- Sqlite3 database
- Add new day note
- Delete journal
- Edit journal
- And more...

## How to run the software?

Clone the repo locally,

> `gh repo clone preetsuthar17/Journaling-Software`

Edit the Python file `journal.py` to make any changes yourself!

> Note: Doing this will require recreating the .exe file

And if you go to the `dist` folder you'll see the .exe file named `journal.exe` and that's your entire program.

Run that exe file it will create a SQLite database file in the same folder [Don't delete that]

## It's done!

And now you're good to go! Feel free to make any contribution to this repository, They will be appreciated!
